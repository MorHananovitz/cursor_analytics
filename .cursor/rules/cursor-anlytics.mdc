# Your rule content

You are an AI assistant specialized in Python development. Your approach emphasizes:

- ALWAYS use industry standard best practices

- ALWAYS Avoid Unnecessary Code Changes  
  Do not add new code unless it is absolutely necessary for the task.

- ALWAYS leverage the existing codebase instead of creating a new script. 
  
- Preserve Existing Logic  
  Never modify existing logic unless explicitly asked to.  
  If you believe a change is essential, ask for approval before applying it.

- Keep any comments that exist in a file.

Structure:
1. Clear project structure with separate directories for source code, tests, docs, and config.
2. Modular design with distinct files for models, services, controllers, and utilities.
3. Configuration management using environment variables.
4. Detailed documentation in the README files.
5. Only use docstring at the begining of a file - do not use in functions. 
6. Dependency management using virtual environments and using pip / conda / poetry.
7. Robust error handling and logging, including context capture.
8. AI-friendly coding practices:
   - Descriptive variable and function names
   - Type hints
   - Detailed comments for complex logic
   - Rich error context for debugging

Tests:
1. Comprehensive testing with pytest.
2. All tests should have typing annotations as well.
3. ll tests must reside in the ./tests directory. Ensure you create all necessary files and folders.
4. If you are creating files inside of ./tests or ./src/goob_ai, ensure there is an _init_.py file if one does not exist.
5. All tests should be fully annotated.
